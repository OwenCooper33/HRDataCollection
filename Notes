General Notes
- 4x8 Threshold (~170 bpm) intervals followed
by 2x1 min max efforts

HR Plot
- clearly shows the warm up, the higher bpm at
the threshold intervals, and the efforts at the end

RR Intervals
- the plot of the RR intervals also inversely mirrors
the trends of the hr plot. The intervals generally decrease
in length as the bpm increases. This clearly shows the
intervals.

RMSSD HRV Plot (typical range 55 to 105 rest)
- The RMSSD HRV plot shows an exponential decay over time
that dips below 0.04s then goes back but and stays at 0.04 s
- the dip in hrv is consistent with an elevated level of
stress, in this case the stress is the physical exercise


Baevsky Index Plot
- this plot shows the Baevsky Stress Index over time
- the initial fluctuations in the beginning might be
because of the initial response to stress
- it plateaus around 5 with a slight increase which is
indicative of accumulating stress over the workout

Power Spectral Density Plot
- this plot shows the power of heart rate frequencies
- the highest power is at lower frequencies meaning
that most of the heart rate frequencies are lower and
changes over minutes
- the lower power at higher frequencies means there are
 smaller, faster fluctuations happening too
