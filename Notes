General Notes
- 4x8 Threshold (~170 bpm) intervals followed
by 2x1 min max efforts

HR Plot
- clearly shows the warm up, the higher bpm at
the threshold intervals, and the efforts at the end

RR Intervals
- the plot of the RR intervals also inversely mirrors
the trends of the hr plot. The intervals generally decrease
in length as the bpm increases. This clearly shows the
intervals.
